# Samsung-Bixby-Private-Hackathon
This is part of our project for Samsung's private hackathon.</br>
The competition was about creating skills for Samsung's voice assistant called Bixby.</br>

It will connect BixBy to a database for BIM Models to increase efficiency in the QAQC Period and Evaluation.</br>
